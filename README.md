# KRYPTOS: Solving for K4
Exploring the world of KRYPTOS. K1,K2 &amp; K3 are known but the method of learning is what matters. Hope to attempt K4.

### History from my understanding.
The sculpture sits outside of CIA HQ, with the ciphertext for all to see. The four sections are all different and so far 3 out of 4 are decrypted. It is important to know that two pieces were available in a museum that assisted in the solving of K1 and K2. Sometime in the 1990s, CIA cryptanalyst and others solved the first two panels using plaintext clues available before their removal. The solution to K3 was introduced in 1999 by a man named Jim. If you would like to know more in detail, visit the CIA [website](https://www.cia.gov/legacy/headquarters/kryptos-sculpture/) or check [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos) (fairly reliable for this topic). 

# K1 & K2
Since K1 and K2 are solved let's go for it. The plaintext hints would not help here much since we are only studying the methods. The known resolution can be used to explore important lessons in how K1 was truly solved. There are some hints at why traditional methods failed without some of the history released in 1999.

### Alphabet assumptions:

All analysis begins using the standard A–Z alphabet. The use of the
"Kryptos alphabet" is treated as historical knowledge revealed after
the public solution, not as an assumption available to a blind analyst.

## K1 and K2 Approach
Starting the approach with failing at the usual methods is preferred. Try the Caeser Cipher and what happens? Try to throw different encryption algorithims? Substitutions? For those who prefer to start with some hints, that's alright. There really was no way besides trial and error which is mimicked here best it could be.
